## New Feature: Image Source Detection

In this update, we have introduced a new feature to detect AI-generated images. This is important as AI-generated images are becoming more realistic and difficult to distinguish from human-created ones. 

### How It Works:
- The tool analyzes pixel patterns in the image using advanced machine learning algorithms.
- It compares image characteristics against a trained dataset of both AI-generated and real images.

# Setup Instructions for Image Source Detector

Follow the steps below to set up the Image Source Detector project on your local machine.

Steps to Run the Project:

1. Clone the Repository
   
   Clone the repository using Git by running the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ApexBlitz/Image-Source-Detector.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   
   Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Image-Source-Detector
   ```

3. Install Dependencies
   
   Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the Development Server
   
   Finally, start the development server with the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will launch the project locally, and you should be able to access it on your local server.

Requirements
Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed before running these commands. You can download and install them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
